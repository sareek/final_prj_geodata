<h1>Data</h1>

 Data from two sources mentioned below was used for this study. 

  <ol>
    <li>
      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
    </li>
    <p>
      Air quality Index for US by county from 2015-2019.
    </p>
    <li>
      Census Data
    </li>
    <p>
      Median Household Income by county from 2015-2019.
    </p>   
  </ol>

  <p>
    Data collected from EPA for Air Quality Index was in county level and overall records for 1842 
    counties throughout the United States was present on the data. Data collected from census website
    had records of Median Household Income for 3221 counties. For this study, records of
    Median Household Income and AQI for 1842 counties was considered after dropping counties that 
    do not have AQI values. Also, since the Median Household Income value collected from census data was average
    value for five years and AQI values collected from EPA was just for one year, we averaged out the value of 
    AQI for five consecutive years from 2015 to 2019 and and used that value for analysis. 
  </p>

  <p>
    A new field (Low-Income) was also used for the data analysis in this study. Value of Low-Income was
    either true or false. We considered Low-Income to be true if Median Household Income for that 
    county is less than the average Median Household Income value of the whole United States.

    People who are interest in these kinds of study are encourage to reach out to us through linkedIn. We also plan to create facebook group and 
    held live sessions from time to time inviting data scientists, researchers and other practitioners to discuss relevant problems and find ideas 
    for solutions to those problems.
