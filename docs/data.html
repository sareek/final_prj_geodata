<h1>Data</h1>

We used median household income and air quality data from various counties across the United States.
 Air quality for each county is extracted from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) website. 
Median household income is extracted from the US Census website. Below is the summary of the datasets:

  <ol>
    <li>
      Median household income by county
    </li>
    <p>
      Median household income collected from Census website is the 5-year mean estimates during 2015-2019. 
      Census provides household income for different categories like race, family size, marital status etc.
       We need only total median household income and margin of error to proceed with our analysis. 
    </p>
    <li>
      Annual AQI summary by county:
    </li>
    <p>
      AQI data from 2015-2019 is collected to match with Census data. 
      AQI values for each county is determined by taking average of the AQI values for that county 
      during 2015-2019. 
    </p>   
  </ol>

  <h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
  <p>
    Around 43% of counties has no AQI data. Therefore, we excluded the median household income for these counties to match both datasets. This leaves us with 1,842 counties. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Below is the snapshot of both datasets. First one shows median AQI and number of days with different AQI levels and second dataset shows median household income and margin of error for each county in the United States. Last column in second dataset tells us whether the median household income for a county fall under low-income or non-low (medium/high) income. As per US department of Housing and Urban development, low income neighborhoods are neighborhoods with median household income less than 80 percentage of the US median household income ($65712 for the year 2019).

  <!-- <p>
    Data collected from EPA for Air Quality Index was in county level and overall records for 1842 
    counties throughout the United States was present on the data. Data collected from census website
    had records of Median Household Income for 3221 counties. For this study, records of
    Median Household Income and AQI for 1842 counties was considered after dropping counties that 
    do not have AQI values. Also, since the Median Household Income value collected from census data was average
    value for five years and AQI values collected from EPA was just for one year, we averaged out the value of 
    AQI for five consecutive years from 2015 to 2019 and and used that value for analysis. 
  </p> -->

  <!-- <p>
    A new field (Low-Income) was also used for the data analysis in this study. Value of Low-Income was
    set to be either true or false. We considered Low-Income to be true if Median Household Income 
    for that county is less than the average Median Household Income value of the whole United States.

    The stakeholders for the website include researchers and practitioners trying to study problems related to air pollution in smart cities.
    People who are interest in these kinds of study are encourage to reach out to us through linkedIn. We also plan to create facebook group and 
    held live sessions from time to time inviting data scientists, researchers and other practitioners to discuss relevant problems and find ideas 
    for solutions to those problems.
